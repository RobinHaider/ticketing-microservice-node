* Goto getting started> quick start

* Run this command

 kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.3.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

Note: 
 - My IIs is using port 80 which is also the port for ingress-controller. That's why I was having issue.
 - If you want to change the port of the load-balance. 
 - Download the yaml file from that link. Change the load balancer port from 80 to 81( any other).
